Welcome back, Agent porridge!

You are back on another mission.

Your goal today is to hack this computer, which is running Linux.
By deleting the /bin folder on this computer, everything will stop fuctioning properly.
Therefore, you just need to delete the /bin folder.

However, no matter what you do, you must find the root password.

According to our intelligence, the owner saved a copy of his password in his personal home folder.
However, it is encrypted.

Our intelligence also discovered that the owner enjoyed making text-based RPG games.
We could not guarantee but there may be clues to decrypt the password in the game.

To make it easier for you, we had included a copy of his game in your account.
You can play the game by entering the command: playgame.

We had also included a copy of our specialised decrypter.
After finding the key and the encrypted password, you can use it to decrypt the final root password.
You can use it by entering the command: retrievepass

Since this computer is running Linux, you need to know the Linux syntax.
You can find more information and help about the basic syntax by entering the commmand: help.

That's all. All the best!
