Welcome to the game, adventurer.

You found a treasure box on this island, but you could not find the key to open it yet.

There are four locations on this island, namely the beach, forest, house and the cave.

Your goal is to find the key.

You can move around by entering: go [location]
There may be creatures on this island that will attack you.
You can defend yourself by killing the creature using the command: kill [creature]

After finding the key, you can continue to explore the island, or exit the game.

To view help, you can enter: help.

Have fun!
